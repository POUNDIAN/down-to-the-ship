# And then went down to the ship

## Installation

Using poetry for this repo. Currently I've taken to running things from inside VSCode. If you `Cmd+P` and type `Python: Select Interpreter` you can select the poetry venv, which will fix any import errors.

This project calls a model run inside [LM Studio](https://lmstudio.ai/), available through the LMS inference server.
